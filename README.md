# Thema 8
## About Thema8
Thema 8 is about biological modeling, this repository is created to contain all the code
that is created during this "Thema opdracht". This is a school project
that was set up by the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen NL.

## Project
This project is about re-doing of a research with biological modeling. We had the idea of adding
nitrogen to the model, this was mentioned in the Discussion part of the research. When we received the
model, we came to the conclusion that it was not possible/hard to add
this model because it was a hard coded model of the reality. We decided that we needed to rewrite
it first to be able to work with the model.
